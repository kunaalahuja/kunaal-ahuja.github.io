Solved the travelling salesman problem with 46 cities using the optimization solver.

<!--more-->


• Used the 'Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson' algorithm to solve the travelling salesman problem involving graph of 46 cities. 

• Devised constraint generation approach to solve this in polynomial time.

• Used FICO Xpress optimization solver to code this up.

More details about the optimization problms can be found on [the github repository](https://github.com/kunaalahuja/Optimization)
